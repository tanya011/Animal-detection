# Animal-detection

Used libraries:
- `vidgear` - to open the source file. It can be a video or a live stream from YouTube or a video stored locally.
- `os` - to create a directory named `frames` where frames of the source video are stored. 
- `cv2` - to save a video frame in the `frames` directory in a `.jpg` format.
